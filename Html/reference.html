                <p> What is the introduction of bonsai making?</p>
                <p>  A bonsai is an artistic representation of a mature tree that suggests a scene in nature. A bonsai asks the viewer to see beyond the physical plant to a world beyond. Any woody plant material (tree, vine, shrub or herb) can be used to produce a tree-like shape by means of selective pruning.</p>
